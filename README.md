# SSH Command Manager

## Overview
This project is focused on building a centralized platform for users to securely store and manage SSH commands and device information.  

System administrators often rely on a variety of commands across multiple devices, which can be difficult to track and share efficiently. Without an organized solution, users may waste time searching for the correct commands or risk errors when executing them.

The **SSH Command Manager** aims to solve this problem by providing a simple, user-friendly way to store, organize, and retrieve commonly used SSH commands.

- 👥 **Collaboration Support**: Reduce onboarding time and ensure consistency across teams.  
- ✅ **Error Reduction**: Minimize mistakes caused by outdated or missing documentation.
