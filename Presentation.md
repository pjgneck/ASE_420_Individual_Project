# Command-Captain
by Parker Groneck

## Problem

1. Managing terminal commands and device information manually is time-consuming  
2. No easy way to store, search, or copy commands and device IPs  
3. Lack of visual organization or security for command/device data  
4. No simple way to **share commands or device info** with team members

## The Plan

- Provides a **centralized GUI** to manage commands and devices
- Supports **searching, filtering, importing, and exporting** data
- Features **copy-on-double-click** for quick command/IP use

- Adds **visual improvements**: alternating row colors, header borders, and styled treeviews
